# DevHub
DevHub is a proxy site including games, apps, and a disabler, DevHub is FULLY STATIC, meaning you DONT need a NodeJS instance running Wisp or Bare-Server-Node. This is possible with [tomp.app](https://tomp.app), a public Bare server that is fairly fast. DevHub utilizes [Ultraviolet](https://github.com/titaniumnetwork-dev/Ultraviolet) to reroute packets through the Bare-Server.

# How does it work?
Using [Ultraviolet](https://github.com/titaniumnetwork-dev/Ultraviolet), you can proxy traffic through a [Bare Server](https://github.com/tomphttp/bare-server-node).
